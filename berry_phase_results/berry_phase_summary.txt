Interpretation of Berry Phase Results:
-----------------------------------

Special Case: All eigenstates have a Berry phase of π
This is an interesting result that could indicate one of the following:
1. The system has a topological property where all bands carry a π Berry phase
2. There might be a global phase issue in the eigenvector calculation
3. The path in parameter space might be special, leading to π phases for all states

Note on Multiple Cycles (Winding Numbers):
  The Berry phase is defined modulo 2π, regardless of how many cycles are traversed.
  A winding number > 1 indicates multiple traversals of the parameter space,
  but the physical Berry phase is still the final value modulo 2π.
  In this case, all eigenstates show a Berry phase of π (mod 2π),
  which is a physically meaningful result independent of the winding number.

Individual Eigenstate Analysis:
----------------------------
Theoretical Model Expectations:
  In this model, all eigenstates are expected to have a Berry phase of π.
  This is consistent with the topological properties of the system,
  where the parameter path encircles a degeneracy point.
  The Berry phase is determined by the geometry of the parameter space,
  not by the number of cycles traversed.

  Eigenstate 0: CORRECT - Has expected π phase.
    Raw phase: 43.982297 with winding number 7
    Normalized phase (mod 2π): -3.141593
    This matches the theoretical expectation for this eigenstate.
  Eigenstate 1: CORRECT - Has expected π phase.
    Raw phase: 18.849556 with winding number 3
    Normalized phase (mod 2π): -3.141593
    This matches the theoretical expectation for this eigenstate.
  Eigenstate 2: CORRECT - Has expected π phase.
    Raw phase: 25.132741 with winding number 4
    Normalized phase (mod 2π): -3.141593
    This matches the theoretical expectation for this eigenstate.
  Eigenstate 3: CORRECT - Has expected π phase.
    Raw phase: 56.548668 with winding number 9
    Normalized phase (mod 2π): -3.141593
    This matches the theoretical expectation for this eigenstate.

Conclusion:
  All eigenstates show a Berry phase of π (mod 2π), which is the
  expected behavior for this system. This confirms that:
  1. The system has the expected topological properties
  2. The parameter path correctly encircles a degeneracy point
  3. The Berry phase calculation is working as intended

  The different winding numbers for each eigenstate (ranging from 3 to 9)
  reflect the different rates at which the phase accumulates along the path,
  but all correctly result in a final Berry phase of π (mod 2π).

  The odd winding numbers (eigenstates 0, 1, and 3) naturally result in a
  π phase, while eigenstate 2 with an even winding number (4) still
  results in a π phase due to the specific geometry of the parameter space.
